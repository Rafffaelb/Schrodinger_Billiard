# Schr√∂dinger's Billiard

Hello! My name is Rafael and in this repository I perform numerical simulations to calculate properties of electrical transport in quantum billiards such as conductance, power shot noise, concurrence, entanglement of formation and violations of Bell's inequality. The quantum billiards, also known as quantum dots, are extremely small devices about few nanometers in which the electrons are carried by leads and scattered in a chaotic scatter center, as we can see in the Figure 1 [[1]](#1).

## Conductance

The property which quantify the amount of electrons can pass through the quantum billiard is called quantum conductance. This property is directly related to the probability of an electron goes from a lead to other due the wave-particle duality of the electron. Moreover, the conductance fluctuates around a average and it has a specific variance, this fact is known as universal fluctuations of conductance. The mean, variance and skewness of the distribution of conductance depend on number of open channels in each lead, the potential barrier between the lead and the chaotic resonance cavity and specially the class of symmetry of the hamiltonian.
